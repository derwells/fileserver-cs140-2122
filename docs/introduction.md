\mainpage Introduction

This project is made for the completion of CS 140 21.1 Project 2.

This project is divided into two files:
 - `defs.h`: contains `typedef struct` definitions and other useful macros.
 - `file_server.c`: driver program.

See \ref File_index (!!!) for a detailed description of each file.

 Visit \subpage pg_overview "Overview" for an quick explanation of how the file server works. This section goes over how Level 1-4 requirements are met. Hopefully, this will ease into the in-depth explanations found at:
In-depth explanations for each level requirement can be found at:

- \subpage pg_nonblocking "Non-blocking master" for Level 1 requirements.
- \subpage pg_execution "Command Execution" for Level 2 requirements.
- \subpage pg_concurrency "Concurrency" for Level 3 requirements.
- \subpage pg_synchronization "Synchronization" for Level 4 requirements.
