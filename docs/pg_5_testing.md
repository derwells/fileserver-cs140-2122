\page pg_testing Testing

Various testing procedures were created to supplement the explanations and proofs of the previous chapters.

# Test Generator for Level 2, 4
A Python script was created to test execution and synchronization correctness. The entire program can be found in `generator.py` (see Appendix).

The program involves four (4) stages
 -# Cleanup old files
 -# Test input generation
    - Writing to `test.in`
 -# File server execution
    - Run `./file_server < path/to/test.in`
 -# Analysis of `read.txt`, `empty.txt`, `commands.txt`

The inputs and paths of the generated commands consist of a variable number of 
characters - including non-alphanumeric chars. They can have lengths of 1 to at 
most 50 characters.

Synchronization is tested by keeping track of the expected file contents
over the course of program execution. Every time a `read` or `empty` command
is generated, we track the expected output. *This maintains that commands
to the same file path must be ordered.*

Each entry of `read.txt` and `empty.txt` is parsed and grouped
by their file path. They are then checked against the expected output.

The total number of threads generated by `./file_server` will be `2 + N_CMDS + N_FILES`.
Be careful to not exceed the number of threads allowed by the OS.

## Test sample
Attached is a [sample generated `test.in`](@ref sampletestin) accessing 5 files with 10 commands each ().
Included are the `./file_server` outputs for [`read.txt`](@ref sampleread), [`empty.txt`](@ref sampleempty), 
and [`commands.txt`](@ref samplecommands).

The `./file_server` passess the sample input

```
   Press [enter] once file_server has finished execution:
   [ANALYZING] read.txt
   [ANALYZING] empty.txt
   [ANALYZING] commands.txt
   [GOOD] All tests passed
   Press [enter] for cleanup:

# Integrity Test for Level 2, 4

Below is a short integrity test created for testing execution 
and synchronization correctness.

```
   empty a.txt
   write a.txt 1 2
   write a.txt 3 4
   read a.txt
   write a.txt 5 6
   write b.txt 1 2
   write b.txt 3 4
   empty a.txt
   read a.txt
   read a.txt
   write a.txt 7 8
   read b.txt
   read a.txt
   empty a.txt
   write b.txt 5 6
   empty b.txt
   read b.txt
   write a.txt 9 10
   write a.txt 11 12
   read b.txt
   write b.txt 7 8
   read b.txt
   empty b.txt
   read c.txt
   write c.txt 5 6
   empty c.txt
   read c.txt
   write a.txt 13 14
   read a.txt
   write b.txt 11 12
   write c.txt 1 2
   write c.txt 3 4
   read c.txt
   write c.txt 7 8
   read c.txt
   write b.txt 13 14
   read b.txt
   empty a.txt
   write b.txt 9 10
   write c.txt 9 10
   empty b.txt
   empty c.txt
   write c.txt 11 12
   write c.txt 13 14
   read c.txt
   empty c.txt
   write d.txt 9 10
   read d.txt
   empty d.txt
```

The same ordering is followed by the sample `command.txt` output below

   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write a.txt 11 12
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] read b.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write b.txt 7 8
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] read b.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] empty b.txt

   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] empty c.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] read c.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write a.txt 13 14
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] read a.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write b.txt 11 12
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write c.txt 1 2

   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write c.txt 7 8
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] read c.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write b.txt 13 14
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] read b.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] empty a.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write b.txt 9 10
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write c.txt 9 10
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] empty b.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] empty c.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write c.txt 11 12
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write c.txt 13 14
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] read c.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] empty c.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] write d.txt 9 10
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] read d.txt
   [Thu Dec 30 18:12:57 2021] empty d.txt
```

By analyzing the input we can see the expected `read.txt` and `empty.txt` output of each file
 
`read.txt`
 - `a.txt`: 1 23 4, empty read, empty read, 7 8, 9 1011 1213 14
 - `b.txt`: 12 34, empty read, empty read, 7 8, 11 1213 14
 - `c.txt`: FILE DNE, empty read, 1 23 4, 1 23 47 8, 9 1011 1213 14
 - `d.txt`: 9 10

Inspecting the sample `read.txt` output below, we see that these orderings are reflected

```
   read c.txt: FILE DNE
   read d.txt: 9 10
   read b.txt: 1 23 4
   read a.txt: 1 23 4
   read c.txt: 
   read b.txt: 
   read b.txt: 
   read c.txt: 1 23 4
   read b.txt: 7 8
   read c.txt: 1 23 47 8
   read a.txt: 
   read a.txt: 
   read a.txt: 7 8
   read b.txt: 11 1213 14
   read c.txt: 11 1213 14
   read a.txt: 9 1011 1213 14
```

`empty.txt`
 - `a.txt`: FILE ALREADY EMPTY, 1 23 45 6, 7 8, 9 1011 1213 14
 - `b.txt`: 1 23 45 6, 7 8, 11 1213 149 10
 - `c.txt`: 5 6, 1 23 47 89 10, 11 1213 14
 - `d.txt`: 9 10

Inspecting the sample `empty.txt` output below, we see that these orderings are reflected

```
   empty a.txt: FILE ALREADY EMPTY
   empty c.txt: 5 6
   empty d.txt: 9 10
   empty b.txt: 1 23 45 6
   empty a.txt: 1 23 45 6
   empty b.txt: 7 8
   empty c.txt: 1 23 47 89 10
   empty a.txt: 7 8
   empty b.txt: 11 1213 149 10
   empty c.txt: 11 1213 14
   empty a.txt: 9 1011 1213 14
